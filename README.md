# Vector Measures
A software library  to compare vectors. The measures work in the vector space over the body R. Related to the number frames of the computer, the digits of the vectors are potentially to be assigned with digits of the type integer and float. In principle, there is thus the possibility of calculating non-continuous data points (note data scaling), but whether this calculation should be evaluated in the sense of a comparison is not always given. The implementation follows the original sources, if they can be found, of the description of the measures.

The goal of the library is to be easyly read. This shoudl garantee a good insight to the potential results an cabability of the implementation.
